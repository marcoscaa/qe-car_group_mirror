This version supports the SCAN functional through LIBXC.

# How to compile our QE version with LIBXC

1) Clone both QE and Libxc repositories

  $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:marcoscaa/qe-car_group_mirror.git

  $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:marcoscaa/libxc-car_grp_mirror.git

2) You need to compile libxc before compiling QE. Go to the libxc folder and
     compile the library using:

  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ ./configure --prefix=PATH/TO/LIBXC
  $ make
  $ make install

3) Now, run the configure script in the QE folder:

  $ ./configure

4) You will have to change the make.sys file yourself in order to link libxc to QE.
   Inside make.sys, add

   4.1. MANUAL_DFLAGS  = -D__LIBXC
   4.2. LD_LIBS        = -lstdc++ -LPATH/TO/LIBXC/lib -lxcf90 -lxc

5) Now, you're ready to compile the code. Please note that SCAN is only available
   in PW and CP code. If you want to compile PW, just run (parallel make should
   work):

  $ make -j 4 pw

6) In your input file (CP or PW), add the following line in the &SYSTEM section:
 
   input_dft='SCAN'

****** KNOWN LIMITATIONS ******

1) Our implementation does not support ultrassoft pseudopotentials.

2) Analytical stress tensor in PW does not work with pseudopotentials with non-
    linear core correction

3) We still don't have metagga pseudopotentials. We are currently using PBE pseudo.

This is the distribution of the Quantum ESPRESSO suite of codes (ESPRESSO: 
opEn-Source Package for Research in Electronic Structure, Simulation, 
and Optimization), promoted by the IOM-DEMOCRITOS National Simulation Center 
of the Italian CNR (http://www.democritos.it). 

Quick installation instructions for the impatient:
   ./configure [options]
   make all

############
Please note that in order to use SCAN, you should include some 
lines to the make.sys file. Please check the example script (make.sys.libxc).

("make" alone prints a list of acceptable targets). Binaries go in bin/.
